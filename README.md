# JSHTMLTesting

Welcome! JSHTMLTesting is a repository mainly made for site and HTML + JS Testing.

You will find SOME VERY RANDOM stuff here.

Like this [test that no one cares about!](https://st5sneaky.github.io/JSHTMLTesting/HTML/TEST1.html)

Most likely that the site tests(?) will be in the HTML folder!
